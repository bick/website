            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              I&apos;m Owen, I&apos;m a product consultant and web developer that currently lives in
              Boston. I&apos;ve helped many companies build digital products that are
              more human. My philosophy is simple: design products in a way that
              allows someone to use the product for the first time and feel like
              they understand what they&apos;re looking at. They don&apos;t need to be
              experts, but a digital product should not be overwhelming.
              <br />
              <br />I started developing for the web as a hobby about 12 years ago so I know the tech jargon that matters the most in some of the most complex business cases. I have worked as a software engineer professionally for about 5 years where I have gained an aptitude for simplifying and building out complex infrastructures as economically as possible.
              <br />
              <br />I generally focus on working with startups (Series A, B, &amp; C rounds) who are looking to build a digital product, raise money, and/or expand their engineering and product teams.
