            <br />
            My journey into web development started with WordPress around 2012, where I built a solid foundation in web technologies. Over time, I embraced more complex challenges, eventually specializing in TypeScript and React for frontend development while expanding into full-stack expertise. Today, my technical skill set includes React, Next.js, Node.js, C# .NET, Python, and various other modern frameworks and technologies.
            <br />
            <br />
            I excel at architecting scalable applications, optimizing performance, and delivering exceptional user experiences.
            Beyond coding, I&apos;m passionate about mentoring engineers, maintaining high code quality standards, and making
            strategic architectural decisions that drive business outcomes.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently, I focus on partnering with ambitious Series C+ startups to develop cutting-edge digital products,
            secure funding, and scale their engineering and product teams. I bring a unique blend of technical expertise
            and business acumen that helps transform complex challenges into elegant, cost-effective solutions.
